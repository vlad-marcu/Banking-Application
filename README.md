# Banking-Application
A basic banking application for depositing and withdrawing money

This app simulates a banking application that lets you deposit or withdraw money.
As I haven't implemented a databse to store all the clients yet, you have to enter a username, id and initial balance.Then you have 4 options:

Check balance: It shows your current balance.

Deposit: You can deposit whatever amount of money you want.

Withdraw: You can withdraw whatever amount of money you want, as long as it's less than your current balance.

Show Previous Transaction: It shows the last transaction you made, deposit or withdrawal.

Exit: You exit the app.
